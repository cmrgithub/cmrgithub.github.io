            <h2>Hack Reactor's Javascript Introduction Class</h2>
            <p><span>Hack Reactor</span> is an intensive coding school focusing on Javascript.  I attended one of the introductory courses.  The venue was in a cool space downtown with a fun vibe.  The class was well organized</p>
            <p>The class was pretty basic designed to provide a very cursory overview to a wide range of attendees.</p>
            <p>Hack Reactor is one of many immersive coding schools in San Francisco such as General Assembly and The Holberton School.  They all typically provide intensive bootcamp type training in various web technologies with some job placement assistance at the end.</p>
